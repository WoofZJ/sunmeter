# Sunmeter
This is my toy project trying to implement [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net) using [SDL3](https://libsdl.org/).

# Run
You need cmake & msvc toolchain to build this project on Windows.  
Also, you need to clone SDL before building.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL.git
./run.ps1
```
